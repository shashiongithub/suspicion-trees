## Error Mining with Suspicion Trees

**Error Mining with Suspicion Trees: Seeing the Forest for the Trees,

> In recent years, error mining approaches have been proposed to
> identify the most likely sources of errors in symbolic parsers and
> generators. However the techniques used generate a flat list of
> suspicious forms ranked by decreasing order of suspicion. We
> introduce a novel algorithm that structures the output of error
> mining into a tree (called, suspicion tree) highlighting the
> relationships between suspicious forms. We illustrate the impact of
> our approach by applying it to detect and analyse the most likely
> sources of failure in surface realisation; and we show how the
> suspicion tree built by our algorithm helps presenting the errors
> identified by error mining in a linguistically meaningful way thus
> providing better support for error analysis. The right frontier of
> the tree highlights the relative importance of the main error cases
> while the subtrees of a node indicate how a given error case divides
> into smaller more specific cases.

> In recent years, error mining approaches were developed to help

> techniques they use to enumerate and count n-grams builds on the
> sequential nature of a text corpus and do not easily extend to
> structured data. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for mining
> trees and apply it to detect the most likely sources of generation
> failure. We show that this tree mining algorithm permits identifying
> not only errors in the generation system (grammar, lexicon) but also
> mismatches between the structures contained in the input and the input
> structures expected by our generator as well as a few
> idiosyncrasies/error in the input data.

### Python code coming soon.
